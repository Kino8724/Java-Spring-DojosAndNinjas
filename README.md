# Java-Spring-DojosAndNinjas
A full CRUD Application in Java using the Spring framework that employs One-To-Many relationships (Plus a bonus API to call to).
## To run
You may need to go into `application.properties` found inside the resources folder and change the username and password for the MySQL connection to work. Might need to change the schema name as well to avoid conflict with preexisting schemas.
